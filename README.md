In a galaxy far away, the Vulcan, Ferengis and Betasoid civilization exists, each in their own planet.
They predict weather with a complex computer system which follows this rules:

- When all three planets are aligned with each other and the sun, there is a draft period in the galaxy.
- If the planets aren't aligned, the galaxy will go into a rainy season if the sun is inside the triangle formed by them, having the biggest intensity when the perimeter of said tringule is at it's highest.
- The optimal condition are given when the three planets are aligned with each other but not with the sun.

# Additional information
+ The Ferengi planet moves at a speed of 1 degree/day clockwise and is 500Km away from the sun.
+ The Betasoid planet moves at a speed of 3 degrees/day clockwise and is 2000Km away from the sun.
+ The Vulcan planet moves at a speed of 5 degree/day counter-clockwise and is 1000Km away from the sun.
